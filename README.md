# 2D Space Game

## Leaderboards
- Created nested serializable class
- Save leaderboard data in binary file to make it harder to be manipulated

## Parallax Effect
- Utilize particle system to create stars
- Have stars further away be more dim and move slower to create depth effect
- Stars move outward as they get closer to the bottom of the screen

## Score Keeping
- Lives, score and damage is all tracked and changable to make game play more fun

## Sounds
- Music player persists through game and plays music for game
- Lasers from enemy and player have shooting sound

## TODO
- Add animation for enemy ships to divebomb player and eventually go back to enemy formation if not killed
- Add animation for player ship being spawned
- Possibly more sounds for differnt actions
- More types of enemies with different animations
- Let player choose ship at begining of gameplay
